            <p>Welcome to Lorolingo! üåç</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Lorolingo is a language learning app designed to help children learn vocabulary in a foreign language.
            The app uses children\'s natural ability to hear and distinguish the sounds of foreign languages by linking
            them with everyday objects.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Lorolingo was originally designed with parents bringing up a child in a foreign country in mind,
            but it is equally useful for bilingual parents or parents who wish to give their child a head-start in a foreign language.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Lorolingo is free to use, ad-free and always will be. However, if you would like to support additional features or help me
            with on-going maintenance you can do one of the following:
            </p><br/>

            - watch a short advertisement by clicking the in-app ‚ù§Ô∏è icon.
            <br/>
            - buy me a coffee by clicking right here üëâ buymeacoff.ee/jonathancoffee
            <br/><br/>
            Happy learning!
            <br/>

            <h6>What is Lorolingo?</h6>
            <p>
            Lorolingo is a language learning app designed to help children learn vocabulary in a foreign language.
            The app uses children\'s natural ability to hear and distinguish the sounds of foreign languages by linking
            them with everyday objects
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h6>How can my child use Lorolingo?</h6>
            <p>
            Lorolingo can be used in two ways:
            <br/>
            1) By passing the device to your child, having first selected a language, and allowing them to play and choose images independently.
            <br/>
            2) By selecting a language and interacting with your child. Ask them questions in the target language about the images that appear, and watch them learn!
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h6>Why is the app free?</h6>
            <p>
            Lorolingo started as a side-project of mine with the aim of improving my development skills and filling a gap that
            currently exists in the Android app market - that is, good quality learning resources for parents trying to teach their children a foreign language.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h6>How can I contribute and support the app?</h6>
            <p>
            The app can be supported by pressing the in-app ‚ù§Ô∏è icon and watching a short advertisement, or by buying me a coffee by clicking right here üëâ buymeacoff.ee/jonathancoffee
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h6>I have a feature request, how can I let you know?</h6>
            <p>
